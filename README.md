# Overview
Our objective is to efficiently manage a $1 million liquidity position in the wstETH/ETH Uniswap V3 pool This script monitors the position and alerts via Telegram when action is needed. The system tracks key metrics like price bounds, pool activity, and gas price to balance yields with rebalancing costs.

# Position Strategy
- Allocate 45% to wstETH, 45% to ETH, and 10% for operational reserves.
- Set a conservative Â±0.25% range from the mid-price of wstETH/ETH.

# Monitoring
Essential metrics such as price bounds, pool activity, and gas prices are continuously monitored. Alerts are triggered when:
- Price approaches/exits defined range
- Volume changes >10%
- TVL changes >5%
- wstETH/ETH price ratio changes by >0.3%
- Gas prices favorable for rebalancing

# Rebalancing Strategy
Position adjustment involves assessing the need for rebalancing based on alerts and market conditions. We will use a multi-sig wallet and require multiple signers for any on-chain activity. We manage risks by staying informed about market volatility through continuous monitoring, adjusting price ranges, or temporarily withdrawing liquidity during extreme conditions. 

# Failure Handling

# Productionization Plan

- Each rebalancing decision should weigh expected fee revenue against transaction costs
- Use a secure multi-sig wallet to add/adjust liquidity within this range on Uniswap V3.
